# CollegeFootballRATINGSystem

This program extracts Division 1 College Football game results from a CSV file provided by https://collegefootballdata.com/ and uses 5 rating systems (Elo, Glicko 2, PageRank, BG, and HITS) to rank teams from best to worst. A basic description of the rating systems is below.

A sampling of past rankings can also be found at: https://colinaslett.github.io/.  Once the new season starts, the current rankings and list of predictions for upcoming games will be available at this link as well.
